# Illimat Rules

## Illimat Overview

On each turn, you'll play one card from your hand into any of the four fields on the board. You'll either **Harvest** (collect cards in the field that match the value of the card you've played), **Sow** (discard a card into a field), or **Stockpile** (combine your card with other cards in a field). The Illimat sits in the center of the board and dictates the season of each field, which restricts the actions that can be performed. However, seasons can change, and Luminaries can alter your plans.

The goal of Illimat is to be the first player to earn **17 or more points**. Points are tallied at the end of each round. _Want to learn more? Read on!_

## What's in the Box

- A cloth board, divided into four fields  
- Four metal okus tokens  
- Four scoring tokens  
- A deck of 65 cards, divided into five suits:  
  Spring (Sp), Summer (Su), Autumn (Au), Winter (Wi), and Stars (St)
  Each suit has 13 cards, numbered 1–14.  
  Fools are worth **1 or 14**, decided by the active player  
- Eight Luminary cards (no suit or number)  
- Four player reference cards  
- A cloth bag for token and Luminary storage  
- This booklet  
- The box itself (used as the Illimat)

## Setting Up the Game

1. Choose a dealer. Place the Illimat box bottom at the center of the board, arrow pointing to the dealer.  
2. The dealer shuffles and:
   - Deals **3 cards face-up into each field**
   - Deals **4 cards** to each player (except the player to the left of the dealer, who only gets **3** and goes first)
3. Remaining cards form the draw pile.
4. Each player places an **okus token on top of the Illimat**.
5. **Deal one Luminary face down** into each field corner.

- **2–3 Players:** Remove the **Stars** suit.
- **Beginner Mode:** Play **without Luminaries**.

## Object of the Game

You earn points through harvesting:

- 🌾 **Bumper Crop** – Most total cards: **+4 points**  
- ☀️ **Sunkissed** – Most Summer cards: **+2 points**  
- ❄️ **Frostbit** – Most Winter cards: **–2 points**  
- 🃏 **Fool, Luminary, or okus token** – **+1 point** each

## Turn of Play

On your turn, you:

1. **Play one card** into a field
2. Choose to **Harvest**, **Sow**, or **Stockpile**
3. **Draw back to 4 cards**

## Seasons

Each field has a season that limits available actions:

- 🌬 **Winter:** No Harvesting  
- 🌱 **Spring:** No Stockpiling  
- ☀️ **Summer:** No restrictions  
- 🍂 **Autumn:** No Sowing (Stockpiling allowed)

## On Your Turn

### Playing a Card

- **Sow** – Discard into a field  
- **Harvest** – Use a card to take any combination of cards that equal its value  
- **Stockpile** – Use a card to group other cards to create a new harvestable value; must match the total value with a card in hand

### Changing the Season

If you play a **face card** (Fool, Knight, Queen, King), you **turn the Illimat** to match the played card's season.  
Stars face cards allow the player to choose the season.  
Only a **played** face card changes the season.

### Clearing the Field

If your action empties a field:

- Collect **okus** (if present)
- Reveal and resolve the Luminary (if facedown)
- Claim the Luminary (if already revealed)
- **Reseed with 3 cards** if:
  - You revealed a Luminary, or
  - There were unclaimed okus tokens

Otherwise, the field remains fallow.

### End of Turn

- **Draw back up to 4 cards**  
- Play continues **clockwise**

## Scoring a Round

After all cards are played and the draw pile is exhausted:

- Discard any remaining cards in fields
- Score:

  - **Bumper Crop**: +4  
  - **Sunkissed**: +2  
  - **Frostbit**: –2  
  - **Each Fool, Luminary, or okus**: +1

- **Ties**:
  - Favor the player with most **Luminaries**
  - If tied again:
    - Bumper Crop / Sunkissed: no one scores
    - Frostbit: no one penalized
    - In Beginner Mode: use okus count to break ties


## Core Luminaries

### The Maiden
While the Maiden is on the board, Winter has no effect: cards may be harvested from the Winter field.

### The Changeling
Once during your turn, you may exchange a card from your hand with a card in the same field as the Changeling.  
You can't exchange cards that are part of a Stockpile.  
When claimed, you may immediately exchange two cards from your hand for any two on the board.  
This exchange **does not change the season**.

### The River
When revealed, deal 6 cards into the River’s field.  
If you are **Frostbit** at the end of the round and have claimed the River, **gain 2 points** instead of losing 2.

### The Children
When revealed, deal 3 cards beneath the Children (hidden).  
When claimed, these cards are added to your harvest pile.  
You may examine them, but do not reveal them to other players.

### The Forest Queen
It is always **Summer** in the Forest Queen’s field.  
The Illimat cannot be turned while she is on the board.  
When claimed, you may turn the Illimat to any new position.

### The Rake
Once per turn, you must **Sow one card** into the field with the Rake (before or after your normal play).  
This ignores season restrictions.  
When claimed, each player gives you a **Summer card** from their harvest pile, if available.

### The Union
When harvesting in the Union’s field, you may play **two cards** from your hand and treat them as one card of combined value.  
At the end of your turn, draw back up to 4 cards.

### The Newborn
When revealed, reveal the Luminary in the **opposite field**.  
If that field’s Luminary is already claimed, reveal a new one from the unused pile.  
If a Luminary is already revealed, the Newborn has no effect.

## False Baron's Set

### The Astronomer
When revealed, the player names a **season**. All **Stars cards** are considered that season for the round.

## Crane Wife Expansion

### The Loom
Once per turn, stockpile a card into the Loom’s field **ignoring season rules**.  
Stockpiling this way still changes the season.  
When claimed, **discard your hand** and draw 4 new cards.

### The Island
While The Island is on the board:
- Players may **only interact with that field**.
- All **season effects and other Luminary effects** are ignored.
- The game returns to normal once The Island is claimed.

### The Perfect Crime
When claimed, take an **okus** from another player or the Illimat.  
This occurs after collecting any available okus for clearing the field.

### The Butchers
When revealed, **discard the Luminary in the opposite field**.  
When claimed, you may **force an opponent** to return a collected okus.  
This occurs after you collect any available okus.

### The Soldiers
When you **Sow** into the Soldiers’ field, sow one **additional hidden card** from the deck underneath.  
This also applies to the **initial 3 cards** seeded at the start.

### The Boat
When you harvest from The Boat, you may also harvest from the **opposite field**.  
- If The Boat is in Summer, you may harvest from Winter.
- If it’s in Winter, you **cannot** harvest.  
If both fields are cleared, receive **rewards for both**.

## Other Released Luminaries

### The Audience
Choose one of two variants:
1. When revealed, all players sow one **facedown** card into the field. In 2-player games, each player sows two. Reveal them after all are placed. Players draw replacements at the end of their **next** turn.
2. When revealed, **a spectator** chooses a Luminary that The Audience will act as.

### The Rusalka
When you play **any card** into this field, **change the season** as if you played a face card.  
When claimed, take **one card at random** from each opponent’s hand and add it to your harvest pile.  
Opponents **draw back** only after their **next** turn.

## Clarifications & Rule Corrections

### Clearing a Field (Correct Order)
When you clear the last card from a field:
1. **Draw cards first**, up to 4 in hand.
2. Then, if there are **okus tokens**, take one.
3. If there is a **facedown Luminary**, reveal it and resolve any immediate effect.
4. If there is a **face-up Luminary**, claim it and resolve reward effects.
5. **Reseed** the field with 3 cards if either:
   - You revealed a Luminary this turn, or
   - There were unclaimed okus tokens at the start of your turn.
   Otherwise, the field remains **fallow**.
6. If fewer than 3 cards remain in the deck, do **not** reseed.

### Okus Tokens
- All okus tokens start on the Illimat and are **neutral**, not player-owned.
- Players take them when they clear a field (if any remain).
- At the **end of the round**, all okus tokens are returned to the Illimat.

### Stockpile Limits and Rules
- You may **not harvest a stockpile the same turn** it is created.
- The **maximum value** of a stockpile is **14**, since you must hold a card of that value.
- Once created, stockpiles **cannot be split** or changed except by adding to them with matching values.

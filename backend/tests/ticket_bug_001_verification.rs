/// TICKET-BUG-001 Verification Test Suite
/// 
/// Comprehensive verification following Alice's verification framework for:
/// "Harvest Auto-Collection Critical Fix" 
/// 
/// ISSUE: Harvest forces manual selection between matching cards instead of auto-collecting
/// FIX: Modified harvest logic to auto-collect exact value matches when targets is empty
/// 
/// This test verifies all requirements from the verification framework:
/// 1. Root cause resolution - Fix addresses actual problem source  
/// 2. Reproduction test - Original issue no longer reproducible
/// 3. Regression testing - Fix doesn't break existing functionality
/// 4. Edge case coverage - Similar scenarios also resolved
/// 5. End-to-end verification - Fix works in actual usage context
